## Frontend Engineer and Designer 👨🏽‍💻👨🏽‍🎨
I'm a tactful, diligent, and detail-focused Frontend Engineer and Designer with almost 4 years of experience building software and web experiences. As a designer, I love prototyping and ideating in Figma, Canva, and sometimes even InDesign. I consider myself to be pretty creative (when there's no designer block involved 😭) and design has been a great way for me to express this creativity. I enjoy creating projects in React using tools like React hooks, Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and more. With working experience at Google, Nava PBC, and as a founder and frontend engineer for HI IQ Designs, LLC, I've been blessed with opportunities to work with and learn from a wide array of professionals.

## My Portfolio 🗃️🗂️
My portfolio is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It was also put together using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/), and care. 😁👨🏽‍💻

The app is deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and can be found at the link below:
